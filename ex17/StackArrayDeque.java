//Notes on ArrayDeque (from link above):
//Itâ€™s not thread-safe
//Null elements are not accepted
//Works significantly faster than the synchronized Stack class
//It is a faster queue than LinkedList due to the better locality of reference
//Most operations have amortized constant time complexity
//An Iterator returned by an ArrayDeque is fail-fast
//ArrayDeque automatically doubles the size of an array when the head and tail pointer meets each other while adding an element
