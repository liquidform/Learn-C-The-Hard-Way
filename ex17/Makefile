# Macros are defined as = pairs.

# For better descriptions of flags used, see https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html
# -Wall tells the compiler, cc, to report all warnings (which, in a sick twist of fate, isn't actually all the warnings possible)
# -Wextra prints more warnings but still not all - see `man gcc` for more about these flags if interested
# -pedantic: In short (first paragraph from link above), "Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++; diagnose all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++. This follows the version of the ISO C or C++ standard specified by any -std option used."
# -g flag to get debugging
# TRY -Werror: Make all warnings into errors.
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -g
