//	489 : printf("%ld\n", sizeof(struct Address)); // 1032 // 1040 when id is of type size_t in struct Address but output of everything else in the print block remains the same. 512 * 2 for each char array = 1024. Adding this to int set which is 4 = 1028. This perhaps implies that size_t id is 12 but how can that be if it outputs 8 below? One would expect the output to be 1036 instead of 1040.
